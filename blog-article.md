# Building Modern Full-Stack Apps: Introducing the Cloudflare Router Nx Plugin

> **TL;DR**: I built an Nx plugin that generates React Router v7 apps with React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, and seamless Cloudflare Workers deployment. It's now live on npm and ready to supercharge your edge-first development workflow.

## The Problem: Complex Edge Deployment Setup

As developers, we've all been there. You want to build a modern React app that:
- Runs at the edge for lightning-fast performance
- Has server-side rendering out of the box
- Uses the latest React features
- Deploys seamlessly to Cloudflare Workers
- Integrates well with your existing Nx workspace

But setting this up manually? That's hours of configuration, dependency management, and getting various tools to play nicely together. Not anymore.

## Introducing @10xsai/cloudflare-router-nx-plugin

I'm excited to introduce a new Nx plugin that eliminates all this setup complexity. With a single command, you get a production-ready React Router v7 application optimized for Cloudflare Workers deployment.

```bash
npm install @10xsai/cloudflare-router-nx-plugin --save-dev
nx generate @10xsai/cloudflare-router-nx-plugin:app my-app
```

That's it. You now have a modern, full-stack application ready for edge deployment.

## What Makes This Plugin Special?

### üöÄ Cutting-Edge Tech Stack

This isn't just another React template. It's built with the latest and greatest:

- **React 19.1.0** - The newest React with concurrent features and enhanced performance
- **React Router 7.5.3** - Framework mode with file-based routing and full-stack capabilities
- **TypeScript 5.8.3** - Latest TypeScript with enhanced type checking
- **Vite 6.3.3** - Lightning-fast build tool with modern optimizations
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.4** - Latest utility-first CSS framework

### ‚òÅÔ∏è First-Class Cloudflare Integration

Unlike other solutions that treat Cloudflare as an afterthought, this plugin is built from the ground up for edge deployment:

- **Official Cloudflare Vite Plugin** - Seamless integration with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin`
- **Wrangler CLI Setup** - Pre-configured deployment pipeline
- **Edge-Optimized Builds** - Code splitting and optimization for Workers runtime
- **Environment Management** - Built-in staging and production environments

### üéØ Developer Experience Focus

Every decision was made with developer productivity in mind:

- **File-Based Routing** - Just create files in `app/routes/` and they become routes
- **Type-Safe Everything** - Automatic TypeScript types for routes, loaders, and actions
- **Hot Module Replacement** - Instant feedback during development
- **ESLint Integration** - Pre-configured linting with Nx and React rules
- **Project References** - Optimized TypeScript configuration for faster builds

## Real-World Example: Building a Blog in Minutes

Let me show you how quickly you can build a real application. Let's create a blog with dynamic routes:

### 1. Generate the App

```bash
nx generate @10xsai/cloudflare-router-nx-plugin:app my-blog --style=tailwind
```

### 2. Add Routes

The plugin generates this structure:

```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.tsx      # Home page (/)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ about.tsx       # About page (/about)
```

Let's add blog functionality. Create `app/routes/blog._index.tsx`:

```typescript
import type { LoaderFunction, MetaFunction } from "react-router";

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
  return [
    { title: "Blog | My Site" },
    { name: "description", content: "Latest blog posts" }
  ];
};

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async () => {
  // This runs on the server (edge)
  const posts = await fetch('your-api/posts').then(r => r.json());
  return { posts };
};

export default function BlogIndex() {
  const { posts } = useLoaderData();
  
  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Latest Posts</h1>
      <div className="grid gap-6">
        {posts.map(post => (
          <article key={post.id} className="border rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">
              <Link to={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600">{post.excerpt}</p>
          </article>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

And `app/routes/blog.$slug.tsx` for individual posts:

```typescript
export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ params }) => {
  const post = await fetch(`your-api/posts/${params.slug}`).then(r => r.json());
  if (!post) throw new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
  return { post };
};

export default function BlogPost() {
  const { post } = useLoaderData();
  
  return (
    <article className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-6">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">{post.title}</h1>
      <div className="prose lg:prose-xl" 
           dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content }} />
    </article>
  );
}
```

### 3. Deploy to the Edge

```bash
# Build and deploy
nx build my-blog
nx deploy my-blog
```

Your blog is now running on Cloudflare's global edge network!

## Modern Development Workflow

The plugin provides a complete development workflow:

### Development
```bash
nx dev my-app          # Start development server with HMR
nx typecheck my-app    # Type checking
nx typegen my-app      # Generate route types
nx lint my-app --fix   # Lint and fix issues
```

### Production
```bash
nx build my-app        # Optimized production build
nx deploy my-app       # Deploy to production
nx deploy my-app --environment staging  # Deploy to staging
```

## Advanced Features

### TypeScript Project References

The plugin sets up optimized TypeScript configuration with project references:

- `tsconfig.app.json` - For your React Router application code
- `tsconfig.node.json` - For build tools like Vite
- `tsconfig.cloudflare.json` - For Cloudflare-specific deployment code

This means faster builds, better IDE performance, and isolated configurations.

### Cloudflare Bindings Support

Need a database? KV storage? R2 object storage? The plugin generates a `wrangler.jsonc` that's ready for Cloudflare bindings:

```jsonc
{
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB",
      "database_name": "my-database",
      "database_id": "your-database-id"
    }
  ],
  "kv_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "CACHE",
      "id": "your-kv-namespace-id"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Styling Options

Choose your styling approach during generation:

- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Latest utility-first framework with modern Vite integration
- **Vanilla CSS** - Traditional CSS with utility classes

## Performance Benefits

### Edge-First Architecture

By running on Cloudflare Workers, your app benefits from:
- **Global distribution** - Your app runs in 300+ cities worldwide
- **Zero cold starts** - Workers have near-instant startup times
- **Automatic scaling** - Handle traffic spikes without configuration

### Modern Build Optimizations

- **Code splitting** - Automatic route-based code splitting
- **Tree shaking** - Dead code elimination
- **Asset optimization** - Image and CSS optimization
- **SSR optimization** - Server-side rendering at the edge
